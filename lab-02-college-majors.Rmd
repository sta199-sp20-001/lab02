You may knit this document to see what the template looks like. 
**When turning a document in on Gradescope, remember to `Knit to PDF`** and 
submit that PDF document. For Lab 02, we are not telling you when to commit -- 
it is up to you to commit at appropriate intervals with meaningful commit 
messages. Be sure to commit **at least three times** during this lab.

Delete everything between the 5 asterisks in your final document. Also, delete
the 5 asterisks.
